# **Implementation of Dijsktra Algorithm for a Point robot**

## Dijsktra Algorithm

Dijkstra algorithm allows to find the shortest path from the starting node to a goal node in a 
weighted graph. 


## Steps to Run the code

Step-1: Change directory into root of the directory
```
cd C:\Users\name\...\Project_2
```
Step-2: Run the python file
```
python Dijstra.py
```
Step-3: User input for the starting node location
```
start x-coordinate:

start y-coordinate:
```
Step-4: User input for the goal node location
```
goal x-coordinate:

goal y-coordinate:
```
Step-5: Tap any button to exit the code after reaching the goal node
